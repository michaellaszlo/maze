# Maze generator

This web page generates a two-dimensional maze by constructing a minimum
spanning tree for a rectangular graph with random edge weights. [Wikipedia
describes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm)
several implementations of this approach. This package uses Kruskal's
algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree.
